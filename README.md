## Project Overview 

Livestock farming is one of the agrobusinesses that became very important and requires better management of information and data, since very few companies in Mexico take care of this topic. Livestock entrepreneurs must collect information regarding productive, reproductive, agronomic, labor, tax, climate and input purchase management, among others. A milking parlor is a clear example of a highly demanding livestock production system in terms of information management. Said system is normally linked to an automated information capture and collection equipment. Even so, the collection of information by itself does not generate any utility for the company, if it is not analyzed or used for decision-making based on evidence. In this project we will talk about data management in the livestock company and how we can make correct use of them, to improve milking and obtain better monetary results, a longer and better quality life for the animals.

## Why this topic?

We are enthusiasts of livestock knowledge, we are convinced that the quality of life of the animals is linked to a better production of milk and meat. At the same time, we are certain that we can support the growth of this industry by giving visibility to an important part of this industry that, until now, has not been so strong and therefore, the owners of livestock companies have managed empirically.

## Data Set description 

'La Montaña De Cataluña' is an important Mexican company dedicated to the raising and milking of dairy cows, thanks to them we have obtained a database of 4000 aprox daily entries corresponding to each head of cattle reproductive age, pregnancy, level of lactation, daily milk production, milk quality metrics, among others. We will make an analysis of 365 days that corresponds to a year of productive lactation of the cows.

The program for excellence for farmers is AFI milk, who share the information with us in .csv format.
