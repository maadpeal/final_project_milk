## Data Cleaning and Analysis
For our final project we decided to use Pandas for its fast and efficient way to manage and explore data. Pandas is a great tool for cleaning up the data which will help us make the code clean so we can decipher parts of the data. After cleaning up our data then we can manipulate and show the data in various ways making it easier for us to analyze the data and define our objectives.

## Database Storage
Since AFI Milk is the main server where we took the information in .csv we decided to processed through Postgres and host in a AWS database.

## Machine Learning
Our machine learning algorithms are Random Forest which can be used for both classification and regression problems and Decision Tree which helps us make a decision about our process.

## Dashboard

We used a DB structure to show in a more dynamic way our results so dairy farmes can have a better presentation. Our results were shown in 
bar, pie, linear and measure graphs in a Tableau Story.
